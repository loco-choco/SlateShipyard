## FreeLookablePlayerAttachPoint
* **Type** : Public `class`
* _Inherents from `PlayerAttachPoint`_ 
* **Namespace** : SlateShipyard.PlayerAttaching

_A PlayerAttachPoint you can use to enable free look._

Because of how the free look code was made, it is only active when sitted on the ship. To be able to use it on custom ships/custom PlayerAttachPoints you can use FreeLookablePlayerAttachPoint. When the game detects that the player is attached to a FreeLookablePlayerAttachPoint it will call AllowFreeLook to know if the player should be able to use free look.
